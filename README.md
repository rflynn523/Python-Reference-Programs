# Python-Reference-Programs

This repository holds sample python code that I made for some assignments in a Robotics Systems class. Both of these programs were made in Google Colab and OpenCV.

Object Rcognition: This program takes in a 20 image dataset and compares each image against the entire dataset in an attempt to recognize each image. Both template matching and color histogram techniques are used to classify each image into one of the 5 classes and also determine some other statistics about each query.

Template Matching: This assignment uses two "Where's Waldo?" puzzles to see the results from different template mathcing methods.
